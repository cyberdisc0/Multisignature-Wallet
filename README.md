# Multisignature-Wallet

A multisignature wallet is a wallet that has multiple owners, and requires a specified number of approvals from the owners before sending transactions. In this multisignature wallet, the owners and required number of approvals are stated in the constructor of the contract. The owners may propose, approve, and execute transactions. Once a proposal has reached the required number of approvals, the transaction may be executed by any of the owners.
